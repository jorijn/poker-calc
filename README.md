# Poker Calculator

This application runs on https://poker.jorijn.com.

## Purpose

Occasionally, a few friends come together to play a game of poker. We settle the differences at the end of game, and pay each other what we owe. I got tired of calculating this by hand, so I wrote a little script for it.

## Q: Why no fancy frameworks?

While I could set up a full Symfony or Laravel stack, there's really no need to overcomplicate things.
